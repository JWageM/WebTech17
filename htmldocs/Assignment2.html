			<p class="question_posed">
				Make sure you have read Paul Ford's article "On HTML5 and the Group That Rules the Web" (see Reader on BlackBoard). What is, according to this article, the key difference between the HTML5 Recommendation published by W3C and the one published by the WHATWG?
			</p>
			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>
				According to the article <abbr title ="Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group"> WHATWG </abbr> was formed as a group by Apple, Mozilla and Opera engineers. Because they were concerned with the direction <abbr title ="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> was taking with XHTML and the lack of interest in HTML by W3C. WHATWG defined a new version of HTML known as HTML5 that standardized the improvements in web browser technology. This allowed the Web browser to behave like a “fast, general purpose computer with smarter forms, better audio and video playback” and documented, rationalized and standardized the growing Web. According to the article “the browser would henceforth be a place for applications—an engine that could run software”. Thereby the Web is no longer a document driven one but an application driven one. Also, WHATWG sees the Web as an evolving platform whilst W3C attempts to formally recommend certain practices.

			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>
				According to <a href = "http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/Web_vs_Internet.asp">this source</a> the world wide web is in fact a portion of the Internet. The Internet is a network of networks connections millions of devices globally. The Web is one of many (albeit most commonly used) way of accessing information on the Internet, it usually uses the HTTP protocol to transmit data over the Internet.

			<p class="question_posed">
				What are the three essential technologies that Tim Berners-Lee created to build the World-Wide Web on top of the already existing Internet infrastructure?
			</p>
			
			<div class="question_answered">
			
				According to the source three essential technologies that Tim Berners-Lee made to build the web are:
				<span class="resource">Link to source: <a href="http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">webfoundation</a></span>
				<dl>
				<dt>HTML</dt>
				<dd>An acronym for HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.</dd>
				<dt>URI</dt>

			<h3 id="A1L1Q4">Question 4</h3>
			<p class="question_posed">
				Create a document with the text "Hello World!" in a word processor such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer. Save the file as a Web page or HTML document and inspect the HTML source using a plain text editor or a browser. Describe the key differences of the exported HTML against a regular HTML document created with a plain text editor. Hint: you could use the HTML <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag with the proper escaping to show some example HTML source code generated by the word processor.
			</p>
			
			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>				
				If a regular plain text editor is used then the code is quite simple and small to create a Hello World program. On the other hand if a word processor is used then the code is much bgger and more detailed for a Hello World program.
				The output using MS Word is 754 lines in comparison with  dozen or so lines needed in a text editor. Some example code of making the program in a word processor is shown below:
				<pre>
					<code>
{mso-style-type:export-only;
mso-default-props:yes;
font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
					</code>

				Find out which port (according to the current IANA assignment) is used for the following protocols:
				<ul id="A1L1Q5List">
					<li>HTTP</li>
					<li>SSH</li>
					<li>FTP</li>
				</ul>
				Provide a one line description of all three protocols, indicate with a link which authoritative source you have used for each description, and why you think your source is authoritative for this topic.
				Encode your answer in an HTML <code>table</code> with an <code>id</code> attribute set to <code>protocolTable</code>. The table should have three rows, one for each protocol. It should have at least four columns: for each protocol, list the protocol name, port number, description and the <strong>authoritative source</strong>. You will need this table in Assignment 2.

			<p class="question_posed">
				Look at the following two HTML paragraphs:
				<pre>
					<code>
&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt; point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another &lt;b&gt;important&lt;/b&gt; point.&lt;/p&gt;
					</code>
				</pre>
				Explain why the HTML of the first paragraph should be preferred. Illustrate this with an example. Also, identify another pair of HTML constructs for which the same rationale holds.			
			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>				
				<code>&lt;Strong&gt;</code> is a semantical tag, used for content markup, while <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> is used for style markup. According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/271743/whats-the-difference-between-b-and-strong-i-and-em"> this</a> stack overflow forum: <blockquote>"The tag strong conveys a meaning - showing the text strongly - while b (for bold) conveys a method - bolding the text. With strong, your code still makes sense if you use CSS stylesheets to change what the methods of making the text strong is."</blockquote>
				Another pair of HTML constructs for which the same rationale holds are the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags where both put the text in italics but <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> has a semantic meaning for emphasis whilst <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> does not.

			<p class="question_posed">
				Identify one similarity and one difference between the HTML elements <code>span</code> and <code>div</code>.

			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>	
				One similarity and one difference of <code>span</code> and <code>div</code> according to <a href="http://htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/spandiv/">this source:</a>
				
			</p>				
			<ul id="spanDivList">
				<li>Similarity: HTML tags apply meaning but the <code>span</code> and <code>div</code> tags have no meaning at all, they are used with CSS to group together a chunk of HTML and hook some information onto that chunk.</li>
				<li>Difference: The difference between the two is that <code>span</code> element is in-line used for a small amount of HTML whilst <code>div</code>(division) is a block line element used to chunk together larger sections of HTML code.</li>

			<h3 id="A1L1Q8">Question 8</h3>
			<p class="question_posed">
				Describe the pros and cons of using the <code>iframe</code> tag in HTML
			</p>			
			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>	
				The pros and cons of <code>iframe</code> are decribed below.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Pros</strong>
			</p>
			<ul id="A1L1Q8Pros">
				<li>You can embed external web content in your page, which has many applications such as:
					<ul id="A1L1Q8ProsChild">
						<li>Embedding third party media</li>
						<li>Embedding code examples</li>
						<li>Embedding third party applets like payment forms</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>All current popular browsers support iframe</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Cons</strong>
			</p>
			<ul id="A1L1Q8Cons">
				<li><code>&lt;frames&gt;</code> allow to break the document into several smaller panels, which each displayed a different document. This was considered to be terribel, and the frame tag was deprecated in HTML5 but the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> or inline frame is still avaliable. A pitfall is using <code>&lt;iframes&gt;</code> to mimic <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> behavior.</li>
				<li>You can embed external web content to your page, but some constructs should not be made with iframe such as photo galleries and forums</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<blockquote>
					Summarizing: “If you need to embed some independent, already-existing HTML document into the current document, use an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. If you are building all of it from scratch together, there is almost no good reason to break a page design into several independent documents, especially if they aren’t actually independent pieces of content.” <a href="http://html.com/tags/iframe/">(http://html.com/tags/iframe/)</a>

			<h3 id="A1L1Q9">Question 9</h3>
			<p class="question_posed">
				List potential benefits of using CSS. (Expected length: 7-8 lines)
			</p>			
			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>
				CSS (in combination with HTML) allows for the separation between style markup and content markup. This separation has many benefits. It increases the accessibility of the web, e.g. screen readers are only interested in content markup and not style markup. From the programming and labor division part it is also beneficial. Some people work on and specialize in the content part and some on the style part, ideally these groups can work independently. Some if the other advantages off CSS are:
				<ol>
					<li><q>Easier to maintain and update</q></li>
					<li><q>Greater consistency in design</q></li>
					<li><q>More formatting options</q></li>
					<li><q>Lightweight code</q></li>
					<li><q>Faster download times</q></li>
					<li><q>Search engine optimization benefits</q></li>
					<li><q>Ease of presenting different styles to different viewers</q></li>
					<li><q>Greater accessibility</q></li>

			<h3 id="A1L1Q10">Question 10</h3>
			<p class="question_posed">
				How would you expect a Web browser to render an emphasized word (i.e., included in an <code>em</code> element) in a paragraph with an italic font style? Check whether your browser behaves according to your expectation.
			</p>			
			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>
				We would expect that the word would be emphasized by printing it in boldface.
			</p>			
			<p style="font-style: italic">
				This is a sentence with style italics.
			</p>
			<p style="font-style: italic">
				This is a <em>sentence</em> with style italics, where the word sentence emphasized.
			</p>
			<p>
				However the tag em didn’t change anything. The reason is that by  default the style for emphasizing is italics. If the font was not set to italics the emphasized word is printed in italics while the rest is not.  When we replace the emphasize tag with the strong tag, the word is printed in boldface.

			<h3 id="A1L2Q1">Question 1</h3>
			<p class="question_posed">
				Read the article by Axel Schmetzke, (2001),"Web accessibility at university libraries and library schools" (See Reader for Week 1 on BlackBoard). 
				Schmetzke found that the most prevalent accessibility error is not having ALT texts for images. 
				With which WCAG guideline does this correspond?
			</p>
			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>
			In 1996 the W3C sponsored the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). Its “quick tips” guidelines introduced concepts of accessible design among which was to use 
			the ALT tag to describe the function of images and animations.

			Summary: The first combination was pure green as the foreground and pure red as the background, which are two colors common in color blindess. 
			The results showed that this combination was terrible for the color contrast check. The second combination was a strong yellow and a blue
			green combination as the foreground and background respectively, which is also a terrible contrast. The third and best combination was using

			<p>
			Native apps are written in one language for a single device (Java for android phones and Objective C for iOS devices) whilst web based apps 
			live in the browser on a device and are written in Javascript and can therefore run on any device. A disadvantage of native apps is that 
			they take longer to develop and take up storage space. A disadvantage of web based apps is that they require an Internet connection

			The IP adress of both the www.few.vu.nl and www.cs.vu.nl was found by opening the command prompt on Windows and typing in ping followed by the 
			address. The adress found for both websites was the same being 130.37.164.154. This is possible as both websites run on the same server.

				Look up information about the new protocol for IP addresses (IPv6, IP version 6). Describe the main features of this protocol and indicate what the reasons 
				are to move from version 4 to version 6. (Expected length: 1/4 page)

			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>
			According to <a href = "http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/ipv6_ipv4_difference.html"> this Webopedia source </a>the reason to move to IPv6 from IPv4 
			is from growing concern that if the number of end systems connectd to the Internet continues to grow the nuber of avaliable IP adresses will not be enough 
			for the increased demand, so the demand for Ip adesses will exceed the supply. An IPv4 IP adress is written as four numbers from 0 to 255 separated by periods 
			for example 1.160.10.240, whilst an IPv6 adress is written in hexadecimal and separated by colons, for example 3ffe:1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf. A list 
			of other possible benefits to IPv6 is shown below:
				<ul>
					<li>No more NAT (Network Address Translation)</li>
					<li>Auto-configuration</li>
					<li>No more private adress collisions</li>
					<li>Better multicast routing</li>
					<li>Simpler header format</li>
					<li>Simplified, more efficient routing</li>
					<li>True quality of service (QoS) also called flow labeling</li>
					<li>Built in authentication and privacy support</li>
					<li>Flexible options and extensions</li>
					<li>Easier admininistration(no more DHCP)</li></ul>

				What are MIME types? Name the most common subtypes of type text. Provide a link to the most authoritative source with the complete list.
			</p>
			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>
			According to <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/mime-types-list.html">Freeformatter</a> MIME is short for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions and 
			is a way of identifying files on the Internet according to their nature and format. For example, using the "Content-type" header value defined in a 
			HTTP response, the browser can open the file with the proper extension/plugin. For text files the most common types for default text/plain are 
			.doc, .htm, .html, .com, .conf, .def and others. On the <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml"> IANA website </a>

				Make sure you have read the blog post <a href="https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/03/12/what-is-a-web-server/">What Is A Web Server?</a> as described in the Week 1 Reader on Blackboard.

				Which authoritative source(s) have you used?
			</p>
			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>
			The HTTP is designed for communications between clients and servers. The most common HTTP request is the GET method which requests data from a specified resource. Conversely, the POST method 
			submits data to be processed at a specified resource. The authoritative resource used is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol draft standard memo published by R. Fielding et. al. in 1999 by the 
			Internet Engineering Task Force(IEFT). The document is linked <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.5">here</a> with the POST method described in section 9.5.

				Most of the well-known HTTP web servers serve HTML and other content to end users. But behind the scenes, there are many HTTP servers that provide services for other web sites.

			<p class="question_posed">
				For the lecture preparation, you should have already made yourself familiar with the material in JavaScript fundamentals on Codecademy, as listed in the Week 2: Reader on BlackBoard. If you did not do this yet, do it now, because you will need it for the next assignment. The tutorial also contains an excercise that explains the console.log(); function.
			</p>
			<p class="question_posed">
				While the Codecademy website lets you conveniently practice and execute your code interactively on their pages, in the real world, your JavaScript code will be hidden in your webpage and be executed when your HTML page is loaded.
			</p>
			<p class="question_posed">
				The very page you are currently looking at, for example, also contains a few calls to console.log(), and these calls should already have been executed when you loaded this page in your browser. Enable the JavaScript console in your favourite browser, so you know you can see all the generated messages. Explain shortly what browser you used and how you have enabled the console.
			</p>
			<p class="question_posed">
				Make sure you have at least tried one or two interesting examples from the tutorial in your own HTML file, so you are sure that console.log(); actually works! .
			</p>
			<div class="question_answered">

			<p class="question_posed">
				For the lecture preparation, you should have already made yourself familiar with the material in the introduction to the HTML DOM on w3schools.com, as listed in the Reader on BlackBoard. If you did not do this, do it now. Show how you can use JavaScript and the DOM API to change the background of the body element to the color red. Also show how you can override the behavior of clicking on an <a> element, using only JavaScript and the DOM API, without other libraries. Check and make sure the code in your answer really works in your browser (If you do not know what an API is, find this out too!).
			</p>
			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>
				To be able to execute JS we subscribed a funtion to the body's onload event. Using: <code> &ltbody onload = "Lab3Q2a();"&gt</code>. Where the body function was defined by:
				</p>
				<p>
				<pre><code>
function Lab3Q2a() {
	var body = document.getElementsByTagName("BODY");
	body[0].style.backgroundColor = "yellow";
	var a = document.getElementById("Lab3Q2b");
	a.addEventListener("click",function(event){alert("changed"); event.preventDefault();})
	return;
}</code></pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that the function above also changed the link's linking behavior. We used <code>&lta id = "Lab3Q2b" href="http://google.nl"&gtgoogle&lt/a&gt&lt/code&gt to hook into the anchor object.
			</p>

			<h3 id="A2L3Q3">Question 3</h3>
			<p class="question_posed">
				For the lecture preparation, should have already made yourself familiar with the basics in the JQuery tutorial, as listed in the Reader on BlackBoard. If you did not do this, do it now. Make sure that the example runs on your machine. Compare the use of JQuery to change the behavior of the <a> element as shown in the example with the code you used in the previous question. List pros and cons of both methods.
			</p>
			<div class="question_answered">
			<p>
				We changed the behavior of the link using the following code:
			</p>
			<pre><code>
$( document ).ready(function() {
	$( "a" ).click(function( event ) {
		alert( "The link will no longer take you to jquery.com" );
		event.preventDefault();
	});
});
			</code></pre>
			<p>
				If the only thing that is need to be done is to disable the default behavior of a link, then using JQuery seems to be given more overhead, it takes more lines to program and the JQuery library must be retrieved.

				AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And Xml. Asynchronous means that when the client makes a request to the server, it doesn’t have to wait for the response, but can continue doing other work. When the requested goods arrive, an event fires, and everything is handled by a previously specified handler function.

			<p>
				Events and event listeners belong to the event-driven programming paradigm. Where programs are always in a never ending loop, during each iteration of the loop it is checked if any event has fired, if so all the event listeners (functions that have subscribed to the event) are called and executed.
